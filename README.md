# Haskell-Type-Inferrer
Infers the type of a given expression. For example, something of the form \x.x+x will infer that x is an integer. Similar to GHCI's :type command to infer the type of a function.  
Project for an RPI course, Principles of Programming Analysis. Missing two files, Data.hs and Util.hs that contain definitions and helper functions, as I am not the owner of that code.
